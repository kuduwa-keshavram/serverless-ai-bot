As a Technical Lead at Apptware, I oversee and manage engineering teams across Java, Python, and Data Science domains. I collaborate closely with new clients to understand their requirements, propose feasible solutions, define resource plans & timelines, and architect scalable systems. Additionally, I optimize processes and mitigate disruptions in ongoing projects to ensure smooth delivery. Alongside leadership responsibilities, I remain hands-on, contributing directly to multiple projects while maintaining billable status.
